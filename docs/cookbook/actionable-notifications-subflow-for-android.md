Can I propose the following changes to the node?

This takes dynamically entered variables and will overwrite them in the notification subflow.  This allows things like images and videos to be dynmically populated, or setting static tags, actions, titles, etc and passing them through to the subflow.  Unless I'm missing something and there was an easier way.  This is my first attempt at a contribution on GitHub, so let me know if I didn't do this right.

I still want to add critical notification options to this as well.

My intent is to use this as a springboard, and also have an option to parse iOS, Google TV, TTS (Google Home & Alexa), and Front End notifications based on naming convention for entities in the services later on.
